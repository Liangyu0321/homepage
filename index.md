I am a fourth year undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in),  majoring in Electrical Engineering, and pursuing a minor in Computer Science. My research interests are in **Computer Vision, Machine Learning** and **Robotics**. 

Last summer, I was a research intern at the [Computer Science Department, Cornell University](http://www.cs.cornell.edu) under [Prof. Ashutosh Saxena](http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/asaxena/index.html), working closely with [Ashesh Jain](http://www.asheshjain.org). Check out the [research]({{site.url}}/research) page of this website to find out more about my work, or scroll down to the [publications](#pubs) section of this page. 


I am passionate about technology, and erstwhile led the [Electronics Club](http://students.iitk.ac.in/eclub/) of IIT-Kanpur. I have given lectures to audiences of 400+ people, organized workshops and competitions, and mentored freshmen and sophomores through technical [projects](http://students.iitk.ac.in/eclub/projects_14.html). I love explaining things in a simpler manner, and have a [blog]({{site.url}}/blog) on this website, apart from authoring guest posts at places like [LearnOpenCV](http://www.learnopencv.com). I have also given a talk about my work at the [Special Interest Group in Machine Learning (SIGML)](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sigml/) at IIT-Kanpur. I love open-source, and try to release as much code as I can on my [github](https://github.com/avisingh599).
